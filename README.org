* BRSYNC
Using rsync copy the contents of a directory to a remote location.
Attempt to simplify navigating arcane rsync arguments.
Use .rsync file (Yaml) specification how to go about it.
  - make sure:
    - hostname is defined in /etc/hosts
    -
  - main development area: ~/proj/RsyncWorkarea/
  - repository: https://github.com/NekiMedo/RsyncWorkarea

* SETUP / WHEEL
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
  $ ls -l dist/*.whl
  $ # on another box:
  $ pip install brsync-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
#+END_SRC

* TODO
 - [ ] Makefile: make clean ... rm -rf dist/ build/
 - [ ] add delete: true/false to config file + override hard coded --delete
 - [ ] add MULTIPLE destinations
   - [ ] pick one from command line argument (brsync hpmini)
